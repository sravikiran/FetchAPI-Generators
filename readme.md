This is a ES6 Generators + Fetch API demo application. It uses babel to transpile ES6 to ES5.

To be able run the sample, you should have Node.js installed and gulp package installed globally. Once you installed these, you can run the sample by executing the following commands from a terminal currently at the same place where the code is located:

npm install
gulp

This command starts a Node.js server on port 8000. Now open a browser and change URL to: http://localhost:8000 to view the application.
